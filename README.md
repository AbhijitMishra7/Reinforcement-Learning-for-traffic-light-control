# Reinforcement-Learning-for-traffic-light-control

Traffic signal controllers generally work on electro-mechanical controllers that use
dial timers with fixed, signalized intersection time plans. These systems are inefficient in
dealing with different scenarios encountered at crossroads. In this
project, we propose a reinforcement learning method for controlling traffic lights in a
wide range of scenarios. We create a crossroad environment whose variables can be
altered to create multiple settings. We use the Q-learning algorithm to train our RL
agent.
